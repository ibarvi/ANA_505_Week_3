#TASK: replace the ? with the function that returns the top rows

#This code chunk shows me the structure 
#Such as number of columns, number of observations, column name, and column type
#Task: Complete the comment above 
#by filling in the blank with what else the str function returns

#Such as Min, First Quartile, Median, Mean, and Max
